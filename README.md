## HOSTING-WEBSITE-USING-LEMP-
LEMP-Based Website Hosting Configuration

This website is hosted on a LEMP stack (Linux, Nginx, MariaDB/MySQL, PHP) deployed on an AWS EC2 instance.
The server uses Nginx as a high-performance web server to handle HTTP requests efficiently, PHP-FPM for fast and secure PHP processing, and MariaDB as the backend database.

##The setup is optimized for:

High performance and low latency

Secure and scalable web hosting

Clean separation between web server and application logic

##Key features include:

Nginx reverse proxy and static file handling

PHP-FPM integration for dynamic content

MariaDB for reliable data storage

Proper file permissions and service management

Production-ready configuration suitable for modern web applications

This configuration is ideal for hosting dynamic websites, CMS platforms, and custom PHP applications in a cloud environment.
